<h3><p> Helium is the second element on the periodic table, 
 Here are ten quick facts about the element helium. 
 like additional element facts.
    The atomic number of helium is 2, 
 the element has 2 neutrons. It is 
 it a stable electron shell. helium in the universe.
Uses of Helium The largest use of helium is in cryogenics.
Helium is the gas making these balloons float. 
Gas is defined as an air-like substance that expands to fill the space it is in. 
It also refers to a substance used as fuel. An example of gas is helium. 
An example of gas is the fuel you put in your car to get it to move.
Inhaling helium displaces oxygen from your lungs, which can cause dizziness, falls and even suffocation. 
 falls and even suffocation. </p>

<p>It's possible for your body to survive without a surprisingly large fraction...
During your lifetime, you will produce enough saliva to fill two swimming pools.
The largest cell in the human body is the female egg and the smallest is the male sperm.</p>

       <li> 1. Helium is the second most abundant element in the universe.</li>
      <li>  2. In 1928 helium became available on the open market for the first time.</li>
      <li>  3. Helium is so light that Earth’s gravity is not strong enough to hold on to it. When helium atoms are released into the atmosphere, they rise until they escape into space. </li>

        </ul>
</ul>

<li>4. Helium is one of only two natural elements that has never been observed bonding to another element in a compound. The other element is neon. Helium plasma can ,however ,form temporary excimer molecules with elements including sodium, fluorine and sulfur.</li>
<li>5. At temperatures close to absolute zero helium condenses to a liquid with amazing properties-the properties of a superfluid, flowing with zero friction up and over the walls of containers.</li>
<li>6. At normal atmospheric pressure helium does not solidify. At 25 atmospheres of pressure helium is a solid at 0.95 K. As the pressure rises, the temperature at which solid helium exists also rises. Helium can be made solid at room temperature if the pressure rises to about 114 thousand atmospheres: that is a pressure of 1.67 million psi, or 834 tons per square inch. This is over 100 times greater than the pressure at the oceans
 deepest point ,the Challenger Deep ,which is almost seven miles deep (10 916 meters).</li>

<p>There is something incredibly neat about helium balloons! If you buy one at the circus or fair, you can hold its string and it will ride along above you. If you let go of the string, it will fly away until you can't see it anymore.</p>


<p>When surface winds are calm, hot air balloon ride pilots can control the altitude of the balloon very finely by heating or venting the air inside. During the day these light surface winds are broken up by “thermals” These are rising columns of warm air that spiral skywards.</p>
